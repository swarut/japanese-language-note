# Using の

の can be used to emphasis the sentence and make it more personal.

> When NOT to Use Plain form no desu?
> Let's say summer vacation in coming soon. The teacher is asking the students where they are going for their holidays. The teacher probably says...
> 
> どこへ行きますか。
> Meaning: Where are you going?
> As the students are still in the classroom wearing their school uniform, the teacher has no idea where they are going for their holidays.
> 
> Therefore she can only ask with a question like "どこへ行きますか" (doko e ikimasu ka).
> 
> When TO Use Plain form no desu?
> Let's say now that you see your neighbour is waiting for taxi with his travel suitcase beside him and he is also carrying a camera.
> 
> It's obvious that your neighbour is going for travel. You want to make sure that he is really going for travel. In this case you can ask him...
> 
> どこへ行く の ですか。
> Meaning: Where are you going?
> As opposed to the first example, it's obvious that your neighbour is going for travel. And you want to confirm that. In this case you can use Plain form no desu in the Japanese sentence.

んです is actually the same, but it is just less formal.
